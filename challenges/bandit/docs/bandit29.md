# [Bandit29->30](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit30.html)

## Level Goal

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo via the port 2220. 
The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Commands useful to solve the level

- [git-branch](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)
- [git-diff](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)

## Helpful Reading Material

- [Branches in a nutshell](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
See [bandit27](./bandit27.md) and [bandit28](./bandit28.md) for more helpful reading material

## Where to start?

Once again, I'll assume that you already cloned the repository (see [bandit27](./bandit27.md) for
more informations).


??? note "Part 1 : Viewing all the branches"

    When we try to view the log and to show the differences in the repository, we don't get any relevant information.

    Another great capability of git is the ability to `branch`. A branch is a line of development which
    is totally independent from all the others from the point when it has been created.

    ??? tip "Hint"

        By looking at the [git-branch](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) man page, can you
        figure out a way to list all the branches in the repository?

    ??? success "Solution"

        We want to list all the branches of the repository. Let's run the following command :
        ```bash
        git branch -a
        ```
        This will list all the local branches (which is only master at the moment) and all the remote tracking branches.
        The following command outputs 3 branches : `dev`, `master` and `sploits-dev`. Let's now see if we can
        retrieve the password in one of these two other branches.

??? note "Part 2 : Viewing the differences between the branches"

    Now that we know that there are multiple branches, we'll try to view the differences between the README.md
    file and the files on the other branches

    ??? tip "Hint"

        Looking at the [git-diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) man page, can you figure out a
        way to view the differences between the master branch and the other branches?

    ??? success "Solution"

        Let's try and run the following command :
        ```bash
        git diff remotes/origin/dev
        ```

        ???+ info

            We need to use remotes/origin/dev because the dev branch is not tracked locally.
            To track the remotes/origin/dev locally you'd have to run `git checkout dev` first.

        When running the following command, we can see that the password is on the `dev` branch and
        use it to connect to the next level.

??? note "Full Solution"

    1. `git branch -a` to view all the branches in the repository
    2. `git diff remotes/origin/dev` to view the changes between the `dev` branch and the master branch

???+ tip

    One key takeaway of this level may be the Git mantra : **branch early and branch often**.
    A branch is cheap, easy to make experiments on and to delete when not needed anymore
